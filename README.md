# Predictive-Modeling-of-Social-Demographics-and-Birth-Outcomes
This project explores predictive modeling using regression techniques. It applies OLS, Poisson regression, and multinomial logistic regression to predict outcomes such as birth date, number of children, and marital status. Using data from the NSFG dataset, models are built to estimate the likelihood of various demographic outcomes.
